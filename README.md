Udemy Building Escape Project with Additions by Me

The goal is to make it to the glass wall balcony where you
can look at the outside world.

Use the mouse, WASD and E for jump to move around the world.
Find the hidden points that open the doors.
The hidden points are triggered by the weight of the item(s)
put onto them. In some cases the only way to pass through the
door is to put something else on the open plate to get the door
to stay open so you may pass through it.
Most, but not all, hidden plates are marked by light.
Different items in the game have different weights so it may
take more than one item to keep the hidden point to stay triggered.

Good Luck!
